   abstract: "The dominant state-of-the-art approach for solving bit-vector
   formulas in Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) is bit-blasting, an eager
   reduction to propositional logic. Bit-blasting is surprisingly efficient in
   practice but does not generally scale well with increasing bit-widths,
   especially when bit-vector arithmetic is present. In this paper, we present
   a novel CEGAR-style abstraction-refinement procedure for the theory of
   fixed-size bit-vectors that significantly improves the scalability of
   bit-blasting. We provide lemma schemes for various arithmetic bit-vector
   operators and an abduction-based framework for synthesizing refinement
   lemmas. We extended the state-of-the-art SMT solver Bitwuzla with our
   abstraction-refinement approach and show that it significantly improves
   solver performance on a variety of benchmark sets, including industrial
   benchmarks that arise from smart contract verification."

   abstract: "Bitwuzla is a new SMT solver for the quantifier-free and
     quantified theories of fixed-size bit-vectors, arrays, floating-point
     arith metic, and uninterpreted functions. This paper serves as a
     comprehensive system description of its architecture and components. We
     evaluate Bitwuzla’s performance on all benchmarks of supported logics in
     SMT-LIB and provide a comparison against other state-of-the-art SMT
     solvers."
